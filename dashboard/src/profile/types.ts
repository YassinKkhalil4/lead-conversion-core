/**
 * Tenant profile: the presentation layer for one vertical.
 *
 * Frontend only. The backend is one multi-tenant engine; it stores generic
 * leads, answers keyed by question key, scores and assignments, and it is not
 * told which vertical a tenant is in. A profile maps those generic records to
 * the words and columns a tenant's team expects. Nothing here changes what is
 * stored, sent or scored.
 *
 * Not in a profile, on purpose: the conversation panel, the handoff control,
 * the temperature badge and the queue's urgency ordering. They render the same
 * in every vertical and take no profile.
